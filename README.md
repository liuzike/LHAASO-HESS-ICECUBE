####### A search for the neutrino signals from the LHAASO and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray sources #########

This repository contains the code used to perform the analysis described in the paper "A search for the neutrino signals from the LHAASO and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray sources" . The code is written in Python 3.8 and uses the following packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, numba, multiprocessing.

### **Description of the code**

The repository is organized as follows:

    - core
    - data
    - outputs


#### **core**

The core/ directory contains the following files:

- download_IC.py : downloads the IceCube neutrino data package and saves it in data/icecube_10year_ps

- stacking_analysis.py : defines the functions used to calculate the Test statistic, and the signal flux model and other miscellaneous functions used in the analysis 

- req_arrays.py : Stores the required data in the form of numpy arrays for faster and easier computation

- readfiles.py : Reads and refines the data from the files and stores them in the form of panda.Dataframes

- signal_bag.py : defines the functions used to compute the Signal and Background PDF in the analysis 

- weights.py : (depercated) defines the functions used to compute the weights of pulsars for the analysis 

- plots.ipynb : plot the fig1 in this paper, a skymap describe all gamma-ray and neutrino events in our analysis

- task4k_single_analysis.ipynb : an correlation  analysis between single gamma-ray source(Separated into WCDA-H.E.S.S. and KM2A-H.E.S.S. lists) and IceCube track events

- task4k_stacking_analysis.ipynb : constraints on neutrino flux based on  stacking analysis.

#### **data**

The data/ directory contains the data used in the analysis. The data are taken from the following sources:

- The IceCube neutrino data are taken from the public HESE and EHE data releases (http://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases/20210126_PS-IC40-IC86_VII.zip). The data are stored in the data/icecube_10year_ps/ directory. The IceCube contains observations spanning over 10 years and is separated into 10 files, each corresponding to 1 year/1 IceCube season.


â€” The LHAASO data catalogue are taken from 2024 ApJS 271 25 and HESS catalogue (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/home/sources/).


#### **outputs**

The outputs/ directory contains the results of the analysis in the form of images.
